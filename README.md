---------------------------

This repository contains legal documents concerning the hosted service at pretalx.com. Each document is placed in its
own subdirectory, where it is available in plain text and as a pdf file, both in English and German.

Publishing these documents in a git repository allows you to compare different versions, and see which change was
introduced at which date. This is especially useful for binding agreements like our Terms of Service.
